            <h2>About Us</h2>
          <p>Established in 2019.This is a Family owned buisness. Rob Howard has always had a passion
            for fishing and dreamed of opening a bait shop. When he saw the old
            bait shop on croft road sitting empty and the fishing community slowing
             due to loosing all of their local access to live bait he acted. He secured
             the building at the old Lakeside General Store and recruited his wife
             Melinda and Brother Bill to be co-owners. A month later we had the grand
             opening of Howard's Lakeside General Store. Everyone you see working at
             the store has shared ownership and are motivated to keep their customers
             satisfied.Stop in and see us at Howard's Lakeside we have everything you need
             to get your boat on the water lots of new rods and more!! Open 7 days a week!
